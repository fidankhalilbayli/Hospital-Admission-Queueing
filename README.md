# Hospital-Admission-Queueing
According to patientâ€™s complaint, the secretariat gives the patient an appropriate code (RED, YELLOW, GREEN).
The order of precedence of the codes is RED> YELLOW> GREEN. 
In addition, each code has a minimum duration of treatment: RED = 1 time slot, YELLOW = 2 time slots, GREEN = 3 time slots.
This minimum length of treatment period is not divisible, which means that even if a new and privileged patient arrives, 
the patient will be treated for the minimum amount of time the color s/he has. T
he patient's color code is renewed after this minimum time expires.
